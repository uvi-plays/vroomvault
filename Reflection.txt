Reflection


During the development of my game, I faced several challenges and made a few mistakes. This reflection aims to explain those issues and how I addressed them.


Mistakes and Issues
1. **Script Communication and References**:
   One of the initial problems was ensuring proper communication between different scripts, especially between `ShopManager` and `BackpackPanelManager`. I initially forgot to create and assign references to other components, causing null reference errors.


2. **Instantiating UI Elements**:
   Another issue was dynamically updating the UI with instantiated prefabs. I struggled with instantiating the purchased items in the backpack panel. Misnaming variables and not correctly setting up prefab references led to errors and confusion.


3. **Managing Backpack Capacity**:
   Implementing the logic for managing the backpack's limited capacity also posed a challenge. Initially, I didn't properly check the capacity before adding new items, leading to scenarios where the backpack exceeded its intended limit.


Solutions and Fixes


1. **Proper Script References**:
   To resolve issues with script communication, I ensured each script had the necessary references to other components. For example, I added a public `BackpackPanelManager` field in the `ShopManager` and assigned it via the Unity Editor, allowing me to call methods directly.


2. **Prefabs and Instantiation**:
   I addressed the prefab instantiation problem by creating a proper prefab for the backpack items and ensuring all necessary components were attached. By following consistent naming conventions, I reduced the likelihood of typos and mismatches.


3. **Capacity Management**:
   To manage the backpack's capacity, I added a check within the `AddToBackpack` method to ensure items were only added if the backpack was not full. Additionally, I displayed a message when the backpack was at capacity, improving the user experience.


In conclusion, these mistakes and issues were part of the learning process. By carefully debugging, seeking references, and systematically addressing each problem, I improved the game's functionality and user experience. This process emphasised the importance of proper planning, thorough testing, and meticulous attention to detail in game development.
